# Video Processing Scripts
 
 Quickly aggregaiting the ensemble of scripts I have for my video processing and distribution to my various Plex servers. Work is needed to standardize and organize these files, but hey, at least they're all in one place now.

Current configuration:

    Distribution happens through Dropbox
    On Windows, Task Scheduler handles the launching of scripts
    On Linux, crobjobs are created
    Backups and file removal happens in the middle of the night

All servers have the following drive mappings:

    D: DATA - where files are distributed, processed, and logs are kept 
    N: NAS - Where finished files are stored
